<br />In 2020, Flatcar, an avid aviation enthusiast on Roblox, conceived the idea of creating the game "Yapton & District" to financially support his burgeoning aviation alliance, 'Skyway.' As the game continued to expand the financial vulnerabilities of alliances made them unprofitable resulting in Skyway's closure in mid 2021 with full focus now on Yapton & District. Since then the game has been thriving through version 3 and into version 4 and soon to be version 4.1.
